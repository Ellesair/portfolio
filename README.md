The purpose of this next.js project is to not only showcase my personal projects
but to also display my current knowledge (as of making this) in regards to clean 
code practices as well as my knowledge of accessible code while displaying my personal style.

This site was built with the mobile first approach so it is responsive on multiple screen sizes.
